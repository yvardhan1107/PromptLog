PromptLog is a browser extension that supercharges your ChatGPT experience.
Long conversations can become difficult to navigate, making it hard to find a specific question you asked.
PromptLog solves this by adding a sleek, dockable sidebar that automatically indexes all of your prompts, allowing you to find and jump to any part of the conversation instantly.

```
*   `manifest.json`: Defines the extension's permissions, icons, and content scripts.
*   `content.js`: This is the main script that runs on the ChatGPT page. Its job is to:
    *   Detect when a conversation is present using a `MutationObserver`.
    *   Inject the `sidebar.html` into the page as an `<iframe>`.
    *   Extract user prompts and send them to the sidebar for indexing.
    *   Handle the logic for docking, collapsing, and expanding the sidebar.
    *   Listen for messages from the sidebar (like `SCROLL_TO_MESSAGE`) and interact with the main page.
*   `sidebar.html`: A self-contained HTML file that provides the structure for the sidebar's user interface, including the header, search bar, message list, and footer. It also contains all the CSS for theming.
*   `sidebar.js`: This script runs inside the sidebar's `<iframe>`. Its job is to:
    *   Listen for messages from `content.js` containing the prompts to be indexed.
    *   Dynamically create the list of indexed items.
    *   Handle all user interactions within the sidebar: searching, toggling themes, refreshing, and collapsing.
    *   Send messages back to `content.js` when an action needs to affect the main page (e.g., when a user clicks an indexed item).
